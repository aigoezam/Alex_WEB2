        <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Alexander Immanuel Goerke Zamora</span></h1>
        <p>
          Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering student from Spain, currently expanding my academic,
          professional, and personal horizons through an Erasmus+ exchange at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
          I enjoy solving engineering challenges with a practical, hands-on mindset – from robotics and digital control
          to electronics, automation, and energy systems.

    <!-- ========== ABOUT ME ========== -->
    <section id="about" class="section">
      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        My name is <strong>Alexander Immanuel Goerke</strong>, and I am currently studying
        <strong>Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering</strong> at Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV).
      </p>

      <p>
        I consider myself a responsible, motivated, and detail-oriented person. I enjoy taking on challenges, working
        on meaningful projects, and continuously improving both technically and personally. I have strong problem-solving
        skills, leadership experience, and a clear, calm communication style.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my academic path, I have gained hands-on experience in areas such as electronics, robotics, control
        systems, energy systems, and automation, supported by real-world experience in sectors like customer service,
        tutoring, and automotive detailing.

    <!-- ========== COPENHAGEN EXPERIENCE ========== -->
    <section id="copenhagen" class="section highlight">
      <h2>My Experience Living in Copenhagen</h2>

      <p>
        Moving to Copenhagen for my Erasmus+ stay at DTU has been one of the most transformative experiences of my life.
        It has pushed me to grow not only as an engineer but also as a person.
      </p>

      <p>
        Living abroad has taught me how to adapt to new cultures, environments, and ways of thinking. Copenhagen has a
        unique atmosphere – calm, intelligent, inspiring, and full of opportunities. Here I learned the importance of
        independence, self-discipline, and the balance between academic life and personal well-being.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond university, this experience has helped me socialize more, make new friends from all around the world, and
        surround myself with people who motivate and push me to become better. I have met incredible individuals, shared
        unforgettable moments, and built friendships that I will carry for life.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can confidently say that Copenhagen has shaped the person I am today – more mature, more social, and more
        prepared for the challenges ahead.
