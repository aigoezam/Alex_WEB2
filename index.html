        <p>
          Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering student from Spain, currently expanding my academic,
          professional, and personal horizons through an Erasmus+ exchange at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
          I enjoy solving engineering challenges with a practical, hands-on mindset – from robotics and digital control
          to electronics, automation, and energy systems.

    <!-- ========== ABOUT ME ========== -->
    <section id="about" class="section">
      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        My name is <strong>Alexander Immanuel Goerke</strong>, and I am currently studying
        <strong>Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering</strong> at Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV).
      </p>

      <p>
        I consider myself a responsible, motivated, and detail-oriented person. I enjoy taking on challenges, working
        on meaningful projects, and continuously improving both technically and personally. I have strong problem-solving
        skills, leadership experience, and a clear, calm communication style.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my academic path, I have gained hands-on experience in areas such as electronics, robotics, control
        systems, energy systems, and automation, supported by real-world experience in sectors like customer service,
        tutoring, and automotive detailing.

    <!-- ========== COPENHAGEN EXPERIENCE ========== -->
    <section id="copenhagen" class="section highlight">
      <h2>My Life in Spain & Copenhagen</h2>

      <p>
        Before arriving in Copenhagen, my life in Spain was defined by constant movement, curiosity, and the ambition to grow.
        I was always searching for new opportunities to learn, gain real experience, and challenge myself both personally and
        academically. Whether it was studying engineering, working, tutoring, or practicing sports, I always tried to maintain
        an active, disciplined lifestyle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sports have been a fundamental part of who I am. I have practiced <strong>padel</strong>,
        <strong>skiing</strong> (snow and water), <strong>taekwondo</strong> (green belt, competition),
        <strong>American football</strong> (competition), <strong>basketball</strong> (competition),
        <strong>climbing</strong>, <strong>gym training</strong>, and even completed a
        <strong>half marathon</strong>. These experiences taught me discipline, teamwork, leadership,
        resilience, and the importance of consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coming to Copenhagen for my Erasmus+ exchange at DTU was a decision driven by the desire to expand my horizons and
        experience life from a new perspective. I wanted to grow independently, understand new cultures, and place myself
        in an international engineering environment where I could develop not only academically but personally as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Living here has been transformative. Copenhagen has helped me become more mature, more confident, and more social.
        I have met incredible people from all around the world, learned to adapt to new environments, and gained a global
        mindset that shapes how I face engineering and life. This experience has strengthened my communication skills,
        pushed me out of my comfort zone, and helped me become a better version of myself.
